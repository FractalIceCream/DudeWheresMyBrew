```
## Descrption

```
We have created a brewery finder that will allow you to search a city and find local breweries, cideriers, or bottleshops. You can choose your current location or you can search any city so you can plan a night out with your friends. When you search for a city, the city is saved and displayed as a button so that if you want to search for that cities breweries, cideriers, or bottleshops, all you have to do is click on it to have the locations displayed again.
